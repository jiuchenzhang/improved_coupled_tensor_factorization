# CTF-PSF and CTF-AC
For running the CTF-PSF and CTF-AC, you need to run the start.m.


We have tested the code on MatlabR2016a. The prerequisite packages to run it are:
1) The Tensor Toolbox Version 2.5 (can be downloaded from: https://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)
2) poblano_toolbox_1.1 (can be downloaded from: https://software.sandia.gov/trac/poblano)
3) The MATLAB CMTF Toolbox Version 1.1 (can be downloaded from: http://www.models.life.ku.dk/joda/CMTF_Toolbox)
Also, in order to use the parallel pool capabilities of Matlab, the Parallel Computing Toolbox has to be installed.

This code accompanies the submission "Improved Coupled Tensor Factorization with Its Applications in Health Data Analysis"
